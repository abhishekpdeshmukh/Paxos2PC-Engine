# Paxos2PC-Engine
Implementation of a fault-tolerant distributed transaction processing system with a focus on two-phase commit for cross-shard transactions and modified Paxos for intra-shard consensus. Data is partitioned into replicated shards for fault tolerance, and performance metrics include throughput and latency.
