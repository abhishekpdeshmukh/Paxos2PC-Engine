# Paxos2PC-Engine
Implementation of a fault-tolerant distributed transaction processing system with a focus on two-phase commit for cross-shard transactions and modified Paxos for intra-shard consensus. The system partitions data into shards replicated across clusters, supporting both intra-shard and cross-shard transactions.
